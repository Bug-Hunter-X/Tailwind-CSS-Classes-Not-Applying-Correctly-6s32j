# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Correctly

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying correctly, leading to unexpected layout or styling problems. The `bug.html` file showcases the issue, while `bugSolution.html` provides the solution.

## Issue Description

In the `bug.html` file, two divs are expected to be side by side. However, due to an error in how the Tailwind classes are applied, this will not work as intended. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` shows the corrected code that fixes the layout issue. The solution involves correctly applying the `flex` and `w-1/2` classes to achieve the intended layout.
